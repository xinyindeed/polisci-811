## Final Project Analysis Plan
This is an anlysis for a survey experiment I conducted. The analysis will look at the relationship between social norm perception and intention of behavior in the context of social influential message of marijuana use. The study has 3 hypotheses and 1 research question. I plan to 
1) clean and re-organize the data based on a between subject design (dummy code?)
2) Conduct one multiple regression based on hypothesis 1
3) conduct mediation analysis on top of the multiple regression model from 1) 
4) (Compare the two model's R squared??)
Here are my plans for now. Since I am using this for a class paper, I am hoping to finish the analysis as early as possible, may need some help in the regression interpretation and visualization part.
