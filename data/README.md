The repository includes one present study thatinvestigated the relationship between descriptive norm of marijuana use, intent, and resistance to peer pressure among college students in the marijuana context. 

The main analyses test a series of hypotheses with a univariate approach. The first ANOVA analysis compared level of descriptive norm of marijuana use across all four conditions and detect if there is any significant difference. The second ANOVA compared level of intent to smoke marijuana across all four conditions to detect if there is any significant difference. The final set of analyses used generalized linear model (GLM) to detect if a resistance to peer pressure is a significant moderator that moderates the relationship between descriptive norm of marijuana use and intent to smoke marijuana.
